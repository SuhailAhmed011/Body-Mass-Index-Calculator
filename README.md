# Body-Mass-Index-Calculator

A simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project helps users calculate their BMI based on their weight and height inputs, providing them with an understanding of their overall health status. 

## Features
- Calculates BMI based on user input for weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters).
- Displays the calculated BMI value along with a message indicating the BMI category (e.g., Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese).
- Provides a visual representation of the BMI value using a color-coded scale.
- Offers a simple and intuitive user interface for entering weight and height data.

## Usage
Open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Enter your weight and height, then click the "Calculate BMI" button to see your BMI value and category. The color-coded scale provides a quick overview of your BMI status.

This project can be customized to include additional features, such as saving user data, tracking BMI changes over time, or providing personalized health recommendations.

Feel free to fork and modify this project to suit your needs or use it as a learning resource for JavaScript development and health-related applications.
